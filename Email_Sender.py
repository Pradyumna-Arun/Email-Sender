SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and is designed to create secure connection between client and server. Secure 
means that connection is encrypted and therefore protected from eavesdropping. It also validate server identity"""

""" What is smtplib library in Python?
The smtplib module defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any internet machine 
with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon. """

In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, 
rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.
