# Email-Sender
In this project instead of manually sending an email from the mail client
we can directly send an email to any number of recipients from the command line itself by using python's built-in modules for sending email over SMTP servers.	 

For this to work we need to follow below steps
1) Go to your google account in security enable two factor authentication
2) Then set up an app specific password for Python, This password 
will be used by python for logging in to your email account.

Everything else is explained in the code itself.
