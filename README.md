# Email-Sender
In this project instead of manually sending an email from the mail client
we can directly send an email to any number of recipients from the command line itself.	 

For this to work we need to follow below steps
1) Go to your google account and enable two factor authentication
2) Then set up an app specific password for Python, This password 
will be used by python for logging in to your email account.
